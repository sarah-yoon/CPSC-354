\section{Week by Week}\label{homework}

\subsection{Week 1}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
Learned about some tactics and theorems

rfl: a tactic that proves theorems that take the form of X = X \\
rw: a tactic that rewrites a proof\\
one\_eq\_succ\_zero: a theorem that proves 1 = succ 0 (there are also other similar existing theorems like two\_eq\_succ\_one and so on)\\
add\_zero: a theorem that proves a + 0 = a.\\
add\_succ: a theorem that proves a + succ b = succ(a + b)\\
succ\_eq\_add\_one: a theorem that proves succ a = a + 1\\

\subsubsection*{Homework}
Problem 5: \\
a b c are in the set of natural numbers. \\
Prove that both sides are equal to each other. \\
a + (b + 0) + (c + 0) = a + b + c \\
rw [add\_zero] - uses the add\_zero theorem to prove that b + 0 = b \\
This is rewritten to: \\
a + b + (c + 0) = a + b + c \\
rw [add\_zero] - this is done again to prove that c + 0 = c \\ 
This is rewritten to: \\
a + b + c = a + b + c \\
rfl - this proves that both sides that look the same are equal to each other \\

Problem 6: \\
This is the same problem as 5 but will be approached in a different manner. \\
a + (b + 0) + (c + 0) = a + b + c \\
rw [add\_zero c] - specifically applies the add\_zero theorem to c, making c + 0 into c \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
a + (b + 0) + c = a + b + c \\
rw [add\_zero b] - specifically applies the add\_zero theorem to b, making b + 0 into b \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
a + b + c = a + b + c \\
rfl - this proves that both sides that look the same are equal to each other \\

Problem 7: \\
n is in the set of natural numbers. \\
Prove that both sides are equal to each other. \\
succ n = n + 1
rw[one\_eq\_succ\_zero] - rewrite 1 into successor 0
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ n = n + succ 0 \\
rw[add\_succ] - uses the add\_succ theorem to change n + succ 0 into succ(n + 0) \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ n = succ (n + 0) \\
rw[add\_zero] - uses the add\_zero theorem to prove that n + 0 = n \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ n = succ n \\
rfl - this proves that both sides that look the same are equal to each other \\

Problem 8: \\
Prove that both sides are equal to each other. \\
2 + 2 = 4 \\
rw[two\_eq\_succ\_one] - rewrites 2 into succ 1 \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ 1 + succ 1 = 4 \\
rw[one\_eq\_succ\_zero] - rewrites 1 into succ 0 \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ (succ 0) + succ (succ 0) = 4 \\
rw[four\_eq\_succ\_three] - rewrites 4 into succ 3 \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ (succ 0) + succ (succ 0) = succ 3 \\
rw[three\_eq\_succ\_two] - rewrites 3 into succ 2 \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ (succ 0) + succ (succ 0) = succ (succ 2) \\
rw[two\_eq\_succ\_one] - rewrites 2 into succ 1 \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ (succ 0) + succ (succ 0) = succ (succ (succ 1)) \\
rw[one\_eq\_succ\_zero] - rewrites 1 into succ 0 \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ (succ 0) + succ (succ 0) = succ (succ (succ (succ 0))) \\
rw[add\_succ] - changes succ (succ 0) + succ (succ 0) into succ (succ (succ 0) + succ 0) \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ (succ (succ 0) + succ 0) = succ (succ (succ (succ 0))) \\
rw[add\_succ] - changes succ (succ (succ 0) + succ 0) into succ (succ (succ (succ 0) + 0)) \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ (succ (succ (succ 0) + 0)) = succ (succ (succ (succ 0))) \\
rw[add\_zero] - changes succ (succ 0) + 0 into \\
This is rewritten to: \\ 
succ (succ (succ (succ 0))) = succ (succ (succ (succ 0))) \\ 
rfl - this proves that both sides that look the same are equal to each other \\

For level 5: 
add\_zero is a Lean proof that a + 0 = a (a representing any number). In mathematics, there are laws for arithemic. One of them 
is called the identity which applies to addition and multiplication. For addition, it states that m + 0 = m = 0 + m. This is the
exact same as the Lean proof, a + 0 = a, which can also be written as a = 0 + a.

%In case you want to draw automata in Latex, you can use the tikz %package. Here is an example of a simple automaton:
%
%\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=2cm,on grid,auto] 
%  \node[state] (q_1)   {$q_1$}; 
%  \node[state] (q_2) [above right=of q_1] {$q_2$}; 
%  \node[state] (q_3) [below right=of q_2] {$q_3$}; 
%   \path[->] 
%   (q_1) edge  node {0} (q_2)
%         edge  node [swap] {1} (q_3)
%   (q_2) edge  node  {1} (q_3)
%         edge [loop above] node {0} ()
%   (q_3) edge [loop below] node {0,1} ();
%\end{tikzpicture}
%
%By the way, GPT-4 is quite good at outputting tikz code.

\subsubsection*{Comments and Questions}
Learning the root of mathematics is very eye-opening, and I am confident it will be the same for programming languages. 
It provides another perspective for elementary functions like 2 + 2 equals 4, which is different from just knowing it through memorization. 
I feel as though this is why people have been able to expand mathematically. This makes me wonder: how can looking through the core of 
programming help us better current languages (e.g. python, rust)?
%I expect you to read the lecture notes. 

\subsection{Week 2}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
Recursion as a concept using the Towers of Hanoi:
It is broken down into:
 moving a tower of n disks from x to y
 moving a tower of n+1 disks when it is already known how to move a tower of n disks
The algorithm is made up of a bunch of "pushs" and "pops"
The logic overall is a bunch of back and forth movement of the disks 

Lean:
induction proof with: induction n with d hd
succ\_add: proves that succ a + b = succ (a + b)
add\_comm x y: proves that x + y = y + x
add\_assoc: proves that a + b + c = a + (b + c)
add\_right\_comm a b c: proves that a + b + c = a + c + b

Problem 5 Proof in Mathematics:\\
a + b + c =  a + (b + c)\\
0 + b + c = 0 + (b + c) - Basis\\
b + c = 0 + (b + c) - Addition Identity\\
b + c = b + c - Addition Identity\\
Inductive Step:\\
k + b + c = k + (b + c)\\
The goal is to prove that Sk + b + c = Sk + (b + c)\\
S(k + b + c) = Sk + (b + c) - Definition of Addition\\
S(k + b + c) = S(k + (b + c)) - Definition of Addition\\
S(k + (b + c)) = S(k + (b + c)) - Inductive Hypothesis\\
Therefore, by the Axiom of induction a + b + c =  a + (b + c) for all a in the natural numbers set\\
\\
Math to Lean\\
Basis: induction a with hd\\
Addition Identity: zero\_add\\
Definition of Addition: succ\_add\\
Inductive Hypothesis: n\_ih\\

\subsubsection*{Comments and Questions}
The Towers of Hanoi reminded me of solving certain problems by simply using recursion. 
I also remember applying this method to the Fibonacci sequence. This makes me wonder 
how it transfers to math. How does recursion 
appear in mathematics or, specifically, in Lean?

\subsection{Week 3}

\subsubsection*{Homework}
\href{https://github.com/sarah-yoon/CPSC354_Week3/blob/main/README.md}{Week 3 Assignment}\\
\subsubsection*{Comments and Questions}
My literature review is about the cause for many different programming languages, the abstraction of them in the future, and what needs future ones would need to fulfill. 
I found that languages evolved depending on the different needs and users over time. For instance, Domain-specific languages were created to meet specific needs. SQL, being one of them, was created to interact with databases.
Within the topic of abstraction, PLs are bound to become higher level to not worry about lower-level implementation. Examples of the current progress towards abstraction would be AI-assisted programming and declarative programming. 
However, abstraction will not change the usage of current languages like Java, Python, and C++ in the foreseeable future. These languages have made a huge impact and it is shown through their extensive ecosystems and sheer amount of existing codebases. On the other hand, some specific areas use newer languages like Rust and Kotlin. They fulfill more modern needs like memory safety and developer productivity.
Future programming languages would need to deal with challenges like security, AI, and concurrency.

Solving lean logic game is a simple view into proving theorems and the foundations of programming languages. When it comes to the lambda problems specifically, how do real-world challenges complicate the applications of lambda?
